This work allows to classify the cardiographic ECG in normal and abnormal and for the abnormal categories also to classify them in under classify in Tachycardias and Bradycardia using LSTM in a first case then try to add the mechanism of attention to be facliser on paying attention to cardiac ECG regions.
I have two different datasets, but I will only consider one at the start: mitbih. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database contains 48 half-hour extracts from two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings obtained from 47 subjects studied by the BIH arrhythmia laboratory between 1975 and 1979 Twenty-three records were randomly selected from a pool of 4,000 24- hour-long ambulatory ECG records collected from a mixed population of hospitalized (approximately 60%) and ambulatory (approximately 40%) hospital patients. Beth Israel of Boston; the remaining 25 records were selected from the same set to include less common but clinically significant arrhythmias that would not be well represented in a small random sample. souces: https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat
